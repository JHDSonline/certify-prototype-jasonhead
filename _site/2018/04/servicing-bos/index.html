  <h1>Servicing BOS</h1>

  <p>This prototype will include a method to add and change a servicing BOS. In order for the UI to support this new information, a new header needs to be supplied.</p>

  <h2>Important!</h2>
  <p>This prototype is limited. The user should change the district office to Louisiana, and then select a servicing BOS from the Alabama district office.</p>

  <h3>Some rules</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Servicing BOS is set to "None" by default</li>
    <li>The list of servicing BOS that appears by default would be the BOS's that correpsond with the firm's current district office.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Dev note</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>All lists of BOS's for all field offices are included on the page, but hidden with a <code>hidden</code> attribute.</li>
    <li>The list filters by adding a <code>hidden</code> attirbute to all sets of BOS's and then removing the <code>hidden</code> attribute for only the corresponding field office selected in the drop down.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This is not set in stone. AJAX would also be acceptable for loading the BOS lists on the page.</p>
