        <h1>Redesign of Application Overview</h1>

<p>The goals of the redesign are the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Provide application in a more digestible and scannable manner</li>
  <li>Remove unnecessary data points to reduce noise on page</li>
  <li>Place <em>Ad Hoc Reviews</em> in line with the application</li>
  <li>Aside from bringing Ad Hocs in line, the general functionality is about the same as the existing overview, but with a visual refresh</li>
</ul>

<p>This is only a design refresh on the cards in the application overview.</p>

<p>On any of these pages, we need to have the copy reviewed.</p>

<h2>Government users</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Is the alert helpful? Is there anything else that might make it better?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Busness users</h2>
<p>We should probably conduct some research on the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Are the badges descriptive enough?</li>
  <li>Do we need some indicator for new ad hoc reviews or will a new "not started" section suffice?</li>
  <li>Does the "Compete" label make sense? Can we test against "Ready?" We've had issues in our research where firms are not sure how/when they can submit their application.</li>
  <li>Is the way we are pointing people to add contributors helpful?</li>
</ul>
