<h1>Program Actions</h1>

<p>Certify needs to provide a clear distinction between actions that occur on application and actions that occur on a firmâ€™s participation within a program. Because of the way Certify was constructed, the program actions were placed within an application. This is not a logical placement because program actions can take place outside of an application process. </p>

<p>"Program actions" is the broad term to describe what has been sometimes referred to as <em>certificate actions</em>. In the user interface, we should use specific references to the program</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>8(a):</strong> 8(a) Actions</li>
  <li><strong>HUBZone:</strong> HUBZone Actions</li>
  <li><strong>ASMPP:</strong> ASMPP Actions</li>
  <li>etc.</li>
</ul>
