    <h3>As a Vendor Admin, I want to change my email address in Certify</h3>

    <h5>Description:</h5>
       AC:<br>

        * Vendor Admin and/or Helpdesk analyst can change a Vendor Admin's email address<br>
        * The new email address must be verified<br>
        <br>
        Questions:<br>

        * Is this an end-user function, or a helpdesk analyst function?<br>
        * Does the firm need to make any change in Sam.gov first?<br>
<br>
        Context:<br>

        * It is possible that a secretary or spouse may have claimed the business on behalf of the firm owner, and now realizes that the firm owner needs to be the Vendor Admin in Certify. Changing the Email address of the Vendor Admin in Certify (the Email ID) is a simple way to accomplish this. After the email address change, the secretary/spouse would just need to share the password with the firm owner, and the firm owner could start logging in on their own.<br>
