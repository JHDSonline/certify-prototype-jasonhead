  <h4 class="sba-c-question-footnote__heading">Important information</h4>
  <p>If you request <strong>reconsideration</strong>, SBA will reconsider its initial decision not to let your firm participate in the program. You must address all items listed in your decline letter and provide documentation that your firm meets the requirements of the 8(a) program. If your request for reconsideration is denied, you either request reconsideration again or appeal.
  </p>

  <p>If you <strong>appeal</strong>, you challenge the SBA’s decision, which is based on the 8(a) regulation. It’s important to know that if the SBA’s Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) upholds the decision not to admit your firm to the 8(a) program, you can’t apply for reconsideration. </p>

  <p>You must wait at least 12 months from the date of the final agency decision before you reapply to the 8(a) program.</p>

  <p>Read the requirements of the 8(a) program: <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=c9f63df273ec8ecdaca045ed53c33938&mc=true&node=pt13.1.124&rgn=div5#se13.1.124_1101" target="_blank">13 CFR § 124.101 to 13 CFR § 124.111</a>. </p>
