          <p>To be eligible for reconsideration, you must provide documentation requested by the SBA that proves that your firm meets the requirements of the 8(a) Business Development program. By appealing the SBA’s decision, you are disputing the SBA’s decision based on the regulation. If you choose to appeal, and the Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) upholds the SBA’s decision, you will not be able to apply for reconsideration.</p>
