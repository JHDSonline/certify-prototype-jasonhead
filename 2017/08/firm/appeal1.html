<p><strong>To appeal, SBA must receive the following information within 45 days of the date of your decline letter.</strong> See your decline letter under the <a href="messages.html" target="_blank">Messages</a> tab of your 8(a) Initial Application.</p>

<ol>
  <li>The basis of OHA’s jurisdiction in handling your appeal. Look in your decline letter for the reason your firm was denied entry into the 8(a) program. If your firm was denied entry based on any reason other than social disadvantage, economic disadvantage, ownership, or control, then OHA can’t process your appeal.</li>
  <li>A copy of your decline letter and the date you received it</li>
  <li>A brief description of your case and the legal arguments that your firm meets the requirements of the 8(a) program</li>
  <li>The outcome you wish to see from your appeal</li>
  <li>Your name, address, phone, fax (if you have one), email, and signature (or your lawyer’s name, contact information, and signature if your lawyer is handling the appeal)</li>
  <li>A statement of why you believe the SBA’s decision is arbitrary, unreasonable, or contrary to law. Refer to specific parts of your decline letter and related documents or emails.</li>
  <li>Your submission to OHA must include a certificate of service stating how, when, and to whom your appeal was sent. (See below for how to prepare the certificate.)</li>
