<ul>
  <li>The Annual Review is substantially complete.</li>
  <li>Everyone who needs to provide information for this Annual Review has submitted their information. (Once processing begins, new contributors canâ€™t submit.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: The first year in Certify, all business partners must provide their information for an Annual Review. This includes people who own at least 10% of the firm. For entity-owned firms, it includes officers, directors, member representatives, and daily managers.</p>

<p>Once processing begins, the SBA has 30 days (MM/DD/YYYY) to complete this Annual Review.</p>
