<ol>
  <li>Click on the three dots in the taskbar to see the task panel.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Notes for Certify Team</h3>

<h4>The Task Bar (AKA Fun Bar)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The task bar will be sticky when the user scrolls to it. </li>
  <li>The options in the fun bar will be different depending on the status of the application and the role of the user.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Ad Hoc Reviews</h4>
<p>To initiate an ad hoc review, either select "Request info from firm" from the task panel or go to the additional info section at the bottom of the application overview.</p>

<p>Next, the analyst will use a form to request info.</p>

<ul>
  <li>All fields are required</li>
  <li>At least one checkbox must be checked.</li>
  <li>The cancel button will return user to previous page</li>
</ul>

<p>After the request is submitted, a new card will be created. New cards will be created for each ad hoc request, with the latest card appearing first.</p>
