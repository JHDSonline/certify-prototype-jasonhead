  <h1>Certify.SBA.gov Design System</h1>
  <p class="usa-font-lead">Welcome to the certify.SBA.gov design system. Here you will find guidance on components used in the certify.SBV.gov application. These components are built with the <a href="http://standards.usa.gov/">U.S. Web Design Standards</a>. The design system was heavily influenced by <a href="https://design.cms.gov">design.cms.gov</a></p>

  <h2>Name spacing</h2>

  <p>The certify.SBA.gov design system uses a strict naming convention. This helps identify what is part of the design system, what role it plays, and what it pertains to.</p>

  <p>Every part of the design system must be namespaced with <code>sba-</code>, prefixed with its role, and a <a href="http://getbem.com/naming/">BEM syntax</a> convention.</p>

  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Prefix</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <th><code>l-</code></th>
        <td>Indicates layout, generally for building the grid.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th><code>c-</code></th>
        <td>Indicates a component. Components are built specific to the needs of certify.SBA.gov</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th><code>u-</code></th>
        <td>Indicates a utility. Utilities pertain to CSS properties.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>These prefixes can sometimes be followed by a "breakpoint prefix".</p>

  <h2>About using the design system</h2>

  <p>The design system provides a large amount of flexibilty for prototype and development for production. Please be deliberate when using certain utility class and consider using CSS properties when creating new components.</p>
